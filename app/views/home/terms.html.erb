It is important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button; once you do so we will start processing your Order and errors cannot be corrected.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="color:#ffffff;">4.2.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Amending or cancelling your Order: Once you have submitted your Order and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order, nor will you be entitled to a refund (please refer to paragraph 4.4 for details of the process relating to rejected Orders). If you wish to change or cancel your Order, you may contact our Customer Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Merchant in order to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Merchant or that the Merchant will agree to your requests as they may have already started processing your Order.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="color:#ffffff;">4.3.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Payment authorisation: Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed or communicated to the relevant Merchant.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="color:#ffffff;">4.4.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Processing your Order and Merchant rejections: On receipt of your Order, we will begin processing it by sending it to the relevant Merchant and will notify you by email that your Order has been received and is being processed. Please note that any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation e-mail that you may receive each merely indicate that your Order has been received and is being processed by us, and does not necessarily mean that your Order has been accepted by the Merchant. We encourage all our Merchants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Merchant rejects your Order. However, Merchants have the discretion to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="color:#ffffff;">4.5.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Delivery of your Order: Estimated times for deliveries and collections are only estimates.

These prices include VAT, delivery costs and any online payment administration charge. These will be included in the total amount due where applicable.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="color:#ffffff;">5.2.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Payment methods: Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card through the Website.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="color:#ffffff;">5.4.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Card payments: If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the Courier at the time of delivery as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card conforms with the data for the Order. Please note that from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments and transactions; this may result in payments taking up to sixty (60) days to be deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="color:#ffffff;">5.5.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Credit and discount vouchers: A credit or discount may apply to your Order if you use a promotional voucher or code recognised by the Website and endorsed by Vyne, and you pay for any balance by credit or debit card. Please refer to our Voucher Terms &amp; Conditions for the full terms and conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount vouchers. Please note that because of standard banking procedures, your bank or card issuer will initially &quot;ring-fence&quot; the full amount of the Order (before any credit or discount) in your account for between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer), and this amount will therefore be unavailable in your account for that period. The credit or discount will be applied at the time your bank or card issuer transfers the funds for your Order to us, at which point the credit or discounted amount will not be transferred to us and will instead be released by your bank or card issuer back into your available balance. You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Merchant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span style="color:#ffffff;">5.6.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Rejected Orders: Because of standard banking procedures, once you have submitted an Order that you are paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, your bank or card issuer will &quot;ring-fence&quot; the full amount of your Order. If your Order is subsequently rejected by the Merchant (as described in paragraph 4.4 above) or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will not transfer the funds for the Order to us, and will instead release the relevant amount back into your available balance. However, this may take between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer). You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Merchant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.</span>
