""Bled"" pink champagnes generally have a more intense pink robe, but this colour can vary widely with different vintages",Rosé Champagne Saignée
2,"Winemaking at low temperature (max 27 ° C) with maceration on the skins for 4 days, racking and end of fermentation without the skins. The malolactic fermentation takes place naturally.",
3,Fermentation in steel tank,
4,"Fermentation in temperature-regulated stainless steel fermenters,  Full malolactic fermentation",
5,"All the different grapes spent 5 days on cold maceration, where after it was fermented in stainless steel tanks at optimal temperatures between 22-28°C. Here after malo-lactic fermentation took place on wood staves in stainless steel tanks",
6,"Maceration on the grapes occurs at a controlled temperature that varies from 26 till 28°C for about 15/18 days in order to obtain a good extraction of the colour and to keep a good structure able to maintain itself for a long time.
