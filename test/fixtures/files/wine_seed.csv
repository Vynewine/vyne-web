,Double Love Trouble,2013,TRUE,,111,2,"This wine has been elusive and hard to get this last few years, but the new release has just arrived and it is back to its former Nebbiolo blend with Cabernet Sauvignon (last release was Tempranillo with Cabernet). This is artisanal winemaking: making the best of what you have. Indeed I can imagine the climate in McLaren Vale whilst being consistently great for Cabernet does not yield both Nebbiolo which is a late ripener and Tempranillo which is an early ripener each year, so these guys go with the flow, hence the double love motif: it will always be a 50/50 chance of which partner will come to the ball with Cabernet that vintage. We love this blend, both in its native Piemonte where the two grapes are used quite often by top Barolo producers such as Gaja with their Sito Moresco. The Nebbiolo is a more acidity grape which balances well with the richness of McLaren Vale Cabernet.",75,,,,,,116,5,65,,,,

Made from old-vine Barossa Shiraz (50%), Grenache(46%) and Mataro (4%) that was matured in mainly older French barriques, this deeply coloured and beautifully balanced wine has spice, earth, liquorice and red and black fruit aromas, the flavours are sumptuous and rich, yet not at all overdone.",75,,,,,,124,5,71,,,,

,Carignan Grenache Vielles Vignes,2012,FALSE,,124,2,"A beautiful blend of grapes from Carignan and Cinsault which come from older vines. Carignan provides a lovely perfume and instantly recognisable character once you lodge it in your brain, but don't expect to find it growing on any old plot. Only old vines make for good Cariginan and there generally only appear here and there on family plots with the old mixed planting scheme with other varieties. Cinsault gives it the French country signature taste. Quaffable every day wine, with some ripe red cherry, blackberry and sweet spice flavours. The tannins are ripe and soft which gives the wine a good structure. A nice all-rounder and good to pair red meats or poultry.So overall as you guessed, it’s not the most complex of wines. It is light and easy drinking but it lacks fruit and structure to be more of a pleasure to drink. I’m not a fan of over extraction (jammy, fruit bomb style) but this wine needs more riper fruit.

Grapes are sourced from the wild, rugged landscape of Pays Cathare that surrounds the towns of Carcassonne and Limoux with its argilo-calcaire sub strata and home to the AOP Languedoc and Limoux but the vineyards do not stop with the AOP geographical limits and it is from these outskirts that we have sourced some exceptionally interesting wines. One of the great advantages of the region is that it benefits from enviable geographic and climatic conditions allying the warm Mediterranean sunshine which is tempered by the altitude and the cooler nights so characteristic of the foothills of the Pyrenees. These are ideal conditions allowing for the longer, slower ripening of the grapes, providing a superb base for the elaboration of wines that offer intensity, complexity and finesse.

It took him six years of standing back, observing and analysing to give life to this precious and exceptional wine called “V.I.T.” which stands for “Visitare Interiore Terrae”. Precious by its blending. Grenache grapes from 70 year old vines, grown on a magnificent plot in the heart of the ‘Garrigue’ scrubland. Enthusiasm, richness and complexity. Then Syrah grapes, ripened slowly on vines grown on clayey limestone soil giving powerful, silky-smooth tannins, and blended with Syrah grapes grown on the company’s most beautiful schist based land. An elegant bouquet and a sophisticated flavour in the mouth. Also exceptional because it is bold, like the people who gave this land its identity. The story is going on in 2008 and is now taking place near the village of Lesquerde. There, the land is made of high limestone based cliffs and dry soils over which the “tramontane” wind blows... Then Michel Chapoutier’s interest for this region rises again and new wine is born: “L’esquerda”. This outstanding wine is mainly based on beautiful Syrah and Grenache grapes from the nicest granitic terroirs. “L’esquerda”, meaning “the fault in the rock” in Catalan, is the faithful expression of a personality, of the identity of a region.
