Rockford is one of the most beloved small wineries in Australia and has a devoted following that is entirely from word of mouth. They still make the shiraz using the old basket press standing in the courtyard of this quaint old stone building. The grapes are from very old, low yielding dry grown shiraz from some of the oldest blocks in the Barossa. Incidentally it was the O'Callaghan's at Rockford whose enthusiasm and passion for the Shiraz grape itself was one of the reasons these old blocks weren't replaced by back in the 1980s when there was a worldwide demand for Cabernet. They devised a payment scheme whereby the grower was paid by acreage, not by yield, so those with the oldest (and lowest-yielding) were fairly paid even if they produced less grapes than newly planted vineyards. This is a system that has since become adopted in many old world regions including hallowed ground in Burgundy . The rest is history and Australias shiraz is now world-beating, so we have them to thank for saving this national treasure.",

He was 23, and pursuing an MBA in Paris, the economy was in a slump, and prices for bulk wines like the ones St-Cosme produced had crashed. Louis left University save the family business from bankruptcy. He completely changed the way the wines were aged and started bottlingand selling them himself in Paris. Fast-forward to 2013 and he has transformed St.-Cosme from an anonymous bulk wine source to the top winery in Gigondas, and arguably into one of the best estates in the Southern Rhône. Barruol's wines alone are a gift to Gigondas, proof that this appellation, long in the shadow of nearby Châteauneuf-du-Pape, is capable of greatness. The Cotes du Rhone is a shining example of a ""Pret a Porter"" label from a ""Couture House"".",
